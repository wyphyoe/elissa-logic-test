Music Player
------------

	Story
	-----

	I have a music player (JetAudio). Before playing that music player, I normally copies the MP3 songs into JetAudio. Then I start playing music by click "Play" button on JetAudio app's UI. There I can choose the song I want to play. I can repeat all the songs and I can also repeat only the current song. I can pause the playing and resume. I can add or remove songs. JetAudio will play all the songs one after another until the last song. When it finished playing first song, it will continue to the next song. If I choose repeat all, when JetAudio finishes playing the last song, it will go back to the first song and keep playing. I can move back or go to next song if I wish.

	Exercise

Car Grid
--------

	Story
	-----

	Puei and I normally play with remote car. I draw 16x16 grid on the floor. Then I define point A and point B. And I put remote car on point A. And Puei uses remote controller and drive the car to reach point B. When she can move her car to point B. She wons the game. But to make her lose the game, I put some blocks on the grid. So while she is moving her car on grid, she needs to make sure her car doesn't hit these block. If her car hits, she loses the game.

	Exercise
	--------

	Now you have understand how Puei and I play this car grid game. You have to write a logical car grid game. I will define point A and B, car and block in your logical car grid game. If my car hits block while playing your logical car grid game, your program must say "Game Over".
